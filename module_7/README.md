# Module 7: Choose Your Adventure 

This week is "Choose Your Adventure" week where you go deeper on a topic of your choice - this could be:

* Excel or Google Sheets
* SQL
* BI tooling (see the PowerBI file in this folder - PC is required)
* Data Storytelling
* AI Tooling - build a data visualization using lovable.dev, bolt.new, claude.ai etc
* or even trying your hand at Python or R if you are interested! 

Using our class format  - find a series of video lessons and watch and complete them. Then choose a data set and analyze it in your preferred tool, leveraging the video lesson you watched to complete the assignment. 

Goal = Spend 10 hours on the topic of your choice. 

# Video Lessons: 

- [X] Curate the videos you watched for your topic of choice and add here under "Video Lessons". Here is the link to the videos that I chose to watch for my Project this week, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pixlHHe_lNQ&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8HqnmK0gQhfmIdCbxwoAoys&index=9) 
- [X] Ideas for videos could be Alex the Analyst videos on advanced Excel topics, intermediate SQL, or intro to Python from his [Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSNXoAs2FtQ) series.
